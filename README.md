# Thesis_Part1
This project discuss about the fault injection framework designed for digital circuits (ISCAS'85 Benchmark Circuits).
Each folder consists of:
  1. The golden verilog code of the benchmark circuit.
  2. Python files for injecting fault.
  3. Python files for extracting the fault and golden information.
  4. Another python script for comparing faulty and golden output to evaluate the bit-flip information.
